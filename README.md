### About the Project 
This project attempts to recreate maps, figures and statistics from the New York City Stormwater Resiliency Plan in Python. Additionally, the project focuses on open source and reproducible workflows. All work is provided in these notebooks.

You can find many of the final outputs (maps, figures, etc.) in the [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-stormwater-map-analysis/blob/main/analysis.ipynb) notebook. If you're interested in examining all the steps to create this project, please see the other notebooks located in this repository.
